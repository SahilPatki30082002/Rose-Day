          Your smile is fresher than a red rose 🌹, your smile is brighter than a sunflower🌻<br />
          On this special night, I want you to know you are the only person
          that makes my heart beat, who keeps me alive🤗. Every morning when I look at your

          happier than I ever was. You are my home. When I come back every day I want to see the same beautiful, 
          priceless smile on your face. I love you Swagata,
