          Your smile is fresher than a red rose 🌹, your smile is brighter than a sunflower🌻<br />
          On this special night, I want you to know you are the only person
          that makes my heart beat faster staying miles away 🤗. Every morning when I look at your
          face, it makes me more excited than ever. When I see you smile, it makes me more
          happier than I ever was. You are my home, one place I want to come back every day. When I do so
          every time I want to see the same beautiful, priceless smile on your face. I love you Swagata, 
          I love you!! You are sweeter than the fragrance of roses. Always keep smiling❤️. <br />
          I want to give you this rose with lots and lots of lovee🌹❤️
